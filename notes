Okay, so we get our volcanoes and know where they are
And we're getting our earthquake feeds and know where those are
Now how do we mark the ones in danger?

Let's say we do a 30 mile radius. APPROXIMATELY (longitude is different) 0.5 degrees each way
1) Query earthquakes
2) Go through each one, and if it's within 0.5 lon/lat of a volcano, mark it somehow
	a) Sort all volcanoes into categories based on their lat/long values
	b) When starting an earthquake, do an if(), and then only check for proximity in that group, by using another if statement
	bb) If eq lat is within 0.5 of volcano lat, then check if eq lon is within 0.5, then mark it
